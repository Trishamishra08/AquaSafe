AquaSafe 🌊



Smart Water Safety \& Monitoring System



📌 Problem Statement



The Narmada River is one of the most important water sources for central India.

However, increasing industrial waste, sewage discharge, and agricultural runoff

have caused serious water quality issues. These problems affect drinking water,

public health, aquatic life, and overall environmental sustainability.



Currently, water monitoring is mostly reactive, meaning contamination is detected

only after damage has already occurred.
